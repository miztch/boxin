# boxin

A Lambda function that searches for the specific keyword (with X ID) and sends a latest tweet to the Discord webhook.

[Nishimura](https://x.com/slimboy24), of the Japanese comedy duo "Cotton" (Ja: コットン), has been posting (tweeting) a 'Costume Forecast' every morning for several years. Costume forecast is a clothing advice line every morning on X, based on the day's temperature. This repository makes it possible to find the post on the Discord channel every day.

The name of the repository "boxin" comes from the abbreviation he writes at the conclusion of his daily post: "Boku wo shin-ji-te kudasai." (「僕を信じてください」, "Trust me" in English).
